      Letterspace is a celebration of letterform in everyday spaces, founded and curated by designer and educator, Lucy Biggs, senior lecturer at Manchester School of Art.
    </p>

    <p>
      26 designers created the inaugural Letterspace alphabet in 2018 informed by each of their own spaces throughout the UK, America, Canada, Europe and the Middle East. The alphabet was first presented at The Whitworth as part of their Thursday Lates programme</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The alphabet also formed the basis of a workshop day for 26 Key Stage 3 students from schools in the Manchester area, with the aim of inspiring the next generation to study art and design at a higher level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the 26 letters are available to buy in a limited edition of 26, screen printed by <a href="http://www.danmatherscreenprint.co.uk" target="_blank">Dan Mather Screenprint</a> in London, with each designer having selected a bespoke ink and paper. This has been made possible by the kind and generous support of <a href="http://www.slater-harrison.co.uk" target="_blank">Slater Harrison</a>, in partnership with Debbie Wigglesworth of The Paper Collaborative.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, a full Letterspace alphabet, made up of 26 posters, was auctioned at The Whitworth, with proceeds gifted to two charities; <a href="http://www.mustardtree.org.uk" target="_blank">Mustard Tree</a> in Manchester and <a href="http://www.printedbyus.org" target="_blank">Printed by Us</a> in Sheffield.
    </p>

    <p>
      Letterspace has also been kindly supported by Manchester School of Art, <a href="http://www.blushpublishing.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blush</a>, <a href="https://www.alphabetbrewing.co.uk/" target="_blank">Alphabet Brewing Company</a> and <a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com" target="_blank">Dalton Maag</a> who have gifted the use of their typeface, Effra, which is present throughout the Letterspace identity.
